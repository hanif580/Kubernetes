The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:

Create a job named countdown-xfusion.

The spec template should be named countdown-xfusion (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-xfusion

Utilize image fedora with latest tag (ensure to specify as fedora:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.

Execute the command sleep 5

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.
